## Ã€ propos de l'auteur
This project represents my learning journey in programming. I decided to create this tool to automate a task that I found tedious, and this experience allowed me to develop my programming skills and learn how to solve problems creatively. At the time, the calculation of class averages was manual, which could waste a little time. Why don't I use excel ðŸ˜®? First of all because I didn't ðŸ˜… know it, and in addition, for me it was a challenge and it was more fun ðŸ˜€.
